### Introduction:

This is Python code for (re)producing the results in the paper  
"A deep neural network for fast and accurate scatter estimation in quantitative SPECT/CT under challenging scatter conditions,"  
Haowei Xiang, Hongki Lim, Jeffrey A. Fessler, Yuni K. Dewaraja, 2020  
http://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-020-04840-9  
Published in
European Journal of Nuclear Medicine (EJNM)

The results show that using deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) can significantly accelerate the scatter estimation process of SPECT/CT while maintaining similar accuracy to previous Monte Carlo (MC) method.

### Contents:

* Example code for preprocessing, training and testing:
   * ```ipynb/Deep Learning for SPECT scatter estimation v9.ipynb```: Instructions included in the python notebook.
* Pre-trained model used in our paper:  
   * ```model/DCNN_SC_v9.hdf5.h5```: A DCNN model trained with 8 simulated phantom/virtual patient. This is the model we used to generate most of the results in our paper.



### Data:

* Data are separately stored to keep this repository lightweight:

  https://github.com/haoweix/spect-scatter-deep-learning-data

  * That repository stores phantom SPECT projection view data,
    including training data and testing data:
    * ```training_data```: contains 8 sets of simulations that are evenly seperated into 2 sets
      (s1 means set No.1 and s2 means set No.2).
      Each simulation consists of scatter, primary, total projection views, and also attenuation map (mu-map). 
    * ```test_data```: contains 6 test data sets. 
      - ```cat_cali_measure_0822.mat```: measuement of 'calibration' phantom.
      - ```cat_liver_measure_w_noise_0826.mat```: measuement of 'liver' phantom.
      - ```cat_liver_w_noise_Apr2019.mat```: Monte Carlo simulation of 'liver' phantom.
      - ```cat_nema_w_noise_Apr2019.mat```: Monte Carlo simulation of 'NEMA' phantom.
      - ```cat_shell_measure_Aug2019.mat```: First measuement of 'shell' phantom (2 layers of activity).
      - ```cat_shell2_measure_08202019.mat```: Second measuement of 'shell' phantom (3 layers of activity).
  * Per data sharing rules, real patient data is available at Deep Blue https://doi.org/10.7302/v07v-z854.
